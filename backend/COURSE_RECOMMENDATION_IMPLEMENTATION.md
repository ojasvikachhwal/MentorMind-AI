# Course Recommendation Engine Implementation

## 🎯 Overview

This document describes the implementation of the Course Recommendation Engine for the MentorMind project. The system analyzes student assessment scores and recommends appropriate courses based on performance levels.

## ✨ Features Implemented

### 1. **Course Model with URL Support**
- ✅ Added `url` field to the `Course` model
- ✅ Updated database schema to include course URLs
- ✅ Fixed SQLite compatibility issues (changed `JSONB` to `JSON`)

### 2. **New API Endpoint**
- ✅ **`GET /recommend-courses/{user_id}`** - Main recommendation endpoint
- ✅ Score-based course level mapping:
  - Score < 40% → Beginner courses
  - Score 40-70% → Intermediate courses  
  - Score > 70% → Advanced courses

### 3. **Course Database Seeding**
- ✅ **16 courses** seeded across **5 subjects**:
  - Operating Systems (4 courses)
  - Computer Networks (3 courses)
  - OOPs (3 courses)
  - DBMS (3 courses)
  - Coding (3 courses)
- ✅ Each course includes:
  - Title
  - Difficulty level (beginner/intermediate/advanced)
  - URL to external resource
  - Subject association

### 4. **Clickable Course Links**
- ✅ Course titles are formatted as clickable links: `[Course Title](URL)`
- ✅ Supports multiple platforms: Coursera, Udacity, YouTube, etc.

## 🗄️ Database Schema

### Courses Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE courses (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    subject_id INTEGER REFERENCES subjects(id),
    title VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
    level ENUM('beginner', 'intermediate', 'advanced') NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    url VARCHAR(500),  -- NEW: Course URL field
    created_at DATETIME,
    updated_at DATETIME
);
```

### Subjects Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE subjects (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    created_at DATETIME,
    updated_at DATETIME
);
```

## 🚀 API Endpoints

### 1. **Course Recommendations by User ID**
```http
GET /recommend-courses/{user_id}
```

**Purpose**: Get personalized course recommendations based on user's assessment scores.

**Response Format**:
```json
{
  "recommendations": {
    "Operating Systems": [
      "[OS Fundamentals (Power User)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/os-power-user)"
    ],
    "Computer Networks": [
      "[Computer Networking Full Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ5KzG4g6KA)"
    ],
    "OOPs": [
      "[Object-Oriented Programming in Java](https://www.coursera.org/learn/object-oriented-java)"
    ],
    "DBMS": [
      "[SQL for Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/learn/sql-for-data-science)"
    ],
    "Coding": [
      "[Programming Foundations with Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python)"
    ]
  }
}
```

### 2. **Existing Endpoints** (Still Available)
- `GET /courses/recommendations/{student_id}` - Detailed recommendations
- `GET /courses/recommendations/me` - Current user recommendations
- `GET /courses/recommendations/ml/{student_id}` - ML-powered recommendations

## 📊 Score Mapping Logic

The system uses a simple but effective scoring algorithm:

| Score Range | Level | Course Recommendation |
|-------------|-------|----------------------|
| < 40% | Beginner | Basic concepts and fundamentals |
| 40-70% | Intermediate | Problem-solving and advanced concepts |
| > 70% | Advanced | Expert-level topics and specializations |

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Files Modified/Created
1. **`app/models/assessment.py`** - Added URL field to Course model
2. **`app/schemas/assessment.py`** - Updated Course schemas
3. **`app/api/v1/endpoints/courses.py`** - New recommendation endpoint
4. **`seed_courses.py`** - Course seeding script
5. **`init_db.py`** - Database initialization script

### Database Changes
- Added `url` column to `courses` table
- Fixed table naming conflicts (renamed `Question` to `AssessmentQuestion`)
- Updated foreign key relationships
- Fixed SQLite compatibility issues

## 🧪 Testing

### Database Test
```bash
python test_course_recommendations.py
```

This script verifies:
- ✅ All subjects are created
- ✅ All courses are seeded with correct data
- ✅ URLs are properly stored
- ✅ Database relationships work correctly

### API Testing
The new endpoint requires authentication. To test:
1. Create a test user
2. Get JWT token by logging in
3. Include token in Authorization header
4. Test the `/recommend-courses/{user_id}` endpoint

## 🚀 Usage Instructions

### 1. **Start the Database**
```bash
python init_db.py
```

### 2. **Seed the Courses**
```bash
python seed_courses.py
```

### 3. **Start the FastAPI Server**
```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

### 4. **Test the Endpoint**
```bash
# Requires authentication
GET /recommend-courses/{user_id}

# Example response for user with scores:
# Operating Systems: 35% → Beginner courses
# Computer Networks: 65% → Intermediate courses
# OOPs: 80% → Advanced courses
# DBMS: 50% → Intermediate courses
# Coding: 72% → Advanced courses
```

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

   - Collaborative filtering
   - Content-based filtering
   - Personalized learning paths

2. **Advanced Analytics**
   - Learning progress tracking
   - Course completion rates
   - Performance correlation analysis

3. **Platform Integration**
   - Direct course enrollment
   - Progress synchronization
   - Certificate tracking

## 🐛 Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Database Migration Problems
**Problem**: Alembic migration failed due to configuration issues
**Solution**: Used direct database initialization with `init_db.py`

### Issue 2: Table Naming Conflicts
**Problem**: Two `Question` classes with same table name
**Solution**: Renamed assessment question to `AssessmentQuestion`

### Issue 3: SQLite Compatibility
**Problem**: `JSONB` type not supported in SQLite
**Solution**: Changed to `JSON` type for cross-database compatibility

## 📝 Notes

- The system is designed to work with both SQLite (development) and PostgreSQL (production)
- Course URLs are stored as plain text and formatted as markdown links in the API response
- The recommendation algorithm is rule-based but extensible for ML integration
- All seeded courses are real, accessible online resources

## 🎉 Success Metrics

- ✅ **16 courses** successfully seeded
- ✅ **5 subjects** properly categorized
- ✅ **URL field** added to Course model
- ✅ **New API endpoint** implemented
- ✅ **Score mapping logic** working
- ✅ **Clickable course links** formatted correctly
